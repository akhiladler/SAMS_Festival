I want to completely redesign the UI of my website for SAMS Festival 2025 to match this visual direction:

OVERALL STYLE & THEME
Make the site elegant, professional, and inspired by Indonesian culture, matching the aesthetic of my brand Sam’s Studios.

Use a royal blue and gold color palette:

Primary background: #002366 (Deep Royal Blue)

Accent color: #D4AF37 (Metallic Gold)

Secondary background: #F4EBD0 (Beige/Warm Neutral) for soft contrast areas

HEADER
Top left: Logo that says SAMS STUDIOS using gold text on dark blue

Top right: Nav links:

Festival Highlights

Contact

Font for nav: Montserrat Semi-Bold, uppercase, gold text, spacing between letters

HERO SECTION
Centered on screen. Full width.

Heading:
SAMS FESTIVAL 2025 → Large, bold, gold text

Subheading:
A national celebration of Indonesian cinema, art, and performance → white or light gold, slightly smaller

Tagline:
One Nation. Many Stories. → italic or semi-bold below the subheading

Background:

Use soft Indonesian motifs like:

Temple outlines (Borobudur-style)

Batik textures (low opacity overlay)

Traditional elements subtly placed in corners

No galaxy, no fantasy, no stars

CALL-TO-ACTION BUTTONS (right under hero text)
Share Your Vision

Button background: Royal Blue

Button background: Gold

Same font and size

Add hover effect: color inverts or subtle glow

BODY SECTIONS
Use horizontal sections with background color alternating subtly between:

Warm Beige (#F4EBD0)

SECTION STRUCTURE:

CONTACT

Header: CONTACT

Email or contact form

FONTS
Headings: Montserrat Bold

Subheadings: Montserrat Semi-Bold

Body Text: Open Sans Regular or Lato

All fonts should be web-safe or linked via Google Fonts

RESPONSIVENESS
Navigation collapses into hamburger on mobile

Text and buttons scale properly

Use a grid or flexbox layout for easy responsiveness

EXTRA NOTES
Avoid decorative overload. Keep it clean and clear.

Do NOT use galaxy, space, fantasy, or neon styles.

The tone should be professional but creative — like a business pitch for a premium national festival.
