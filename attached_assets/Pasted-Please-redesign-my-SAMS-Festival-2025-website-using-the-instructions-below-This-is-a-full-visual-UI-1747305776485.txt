Please redesign my SAMS Festival 2025 website using the instructions below. This is a full visual UI overhaul. Please follow each detail exactly:

 1.⁠ ⁠GENERAL THEME AND AESTHETIC
Overall look: Elegant, professional, and inspired by Indonesian culture.

Style goal: The website should feel like a national-level creative festival backed by a cinema company.

Layout type: Full-width layout with sections stacked vertically, clean and minimal design.

 2.⁠ ⁠COLORS
Use this color palette throughout the site:

Royal Blue (Primary): #002366

Metallic Gold (Accent): #D4AF37

Warm Beige (Background alternate): #F4EBD0

White: for body text on dark backgrounds

Black or Dark Gray: for footer or text on beige backgrounds

 3.⁠ ⁠TYPOGRAPHY
Use these fonts (Google Fonts are okay):

Headings: Montserrat Bold

Subheadings: Montserrat Semi-Bold

Body Text: Open Sans or Lato Regular

All navigation links and buttons: use Montserrat in uppercase

Ensure spacing and padding are balanced; text should not touch edges

 4.⁠ ⁠HEADER (TOP OF PAGE)
Left side: The logo or name “SAMS STUDIOS” in uppercase, gold text, royal blue background.

Right side: Navigation menu with the following links:

ABOUT

SUBMISSIONS

FESTIVAL HIGHLIGHTS

CONTACT

Font for nav links: Montserrat Semi-Bold, gold color, spaced out slightly.

 5.⁠ ⁠HERO SECTION (MAIN BANNER)
Large title in the center of the screen:
SAMS FESTIVAL 2025 (font: Montserrat Extra-Bold, gold color, very large)

Subtitle directly below:
A national celebration of Indonesian cinema, art, and performance (white or light gold color, medium font size)

Tagline in italics:
One Nation. Many Stories.

Background of the banner:

Use subtle design elements inspired by Indonesian art:

Borobudur or Prambanan temple silhouettes

Batik patterns faded into the corners

Wayang-style outlines

These should be low-opacity and placed in the background so the text is fully readable.

 6.⁠ ⁠CALL-TO-ACTION BUTTONS
Place two buttons below the tagline:

Share Your Vision

Button background: Royal Blue

Text: Gold

Border-radius: medium rounded

Font: Montserrat Bold, all caps

Learn More

Button background: Gold

Text: Royal Blue

Same border-radius and font

Add hover effect to both buttons (e.g. slight brightness increase or text boldening)

 7.⁠ ⁠MAIN BODY SECTIONS (AFTER BANNER)
Use a scrolling page layout with alternating background colors and large section headers. Each section should be in a container with consistent width and padding.

SECTION: ABOUT
Title: ABOUT in gold

Text in white: description of what SAMS Festival is and its mission.

Use background: Royal Blue

SECTION: SUBMISSIONS
Title: SUBMISSIONS in gold

Instructions for filmmakers/artists

Include a button: “Submit Now” (Gold button, blue text)

SECTION: FESTIVAL HIGHLIGHTS
Title: FESTIVAL HIGHLIGHTS

Use beige background

Create image cards or boxes for featured events/films

Cards should have soft shadows, gold borders, clean layout

SECTION: CONTACT
Title: CONTACT

Include a contact form or email address

Add social media icons (white or gold, clean style)

Keep layout centered and simple

 8.⁠ ⁠FOOTER
Background: Black or deep royal blue

Text: White or gold

Include links (same as nav), social media, copyright

 9.⁠ ⁠RESPONSIVENESS
On mobile, make sure the nav bar collapses into a hamburger menu

All buttons should stack and center

Text size should scale appropriately

Padding should adjust for small screens

10.⁠ ⁠DESIGN NOTES
Avoid any galaxy, stars, fantasy, or space themes

This is a grounded, cultural, national-level event

Make the site feel clean and modern, not flashy or cluttered

Use spacing and visual hierarchy to make content scannable
